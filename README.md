### Hey there! üëã

My name is **Dmitrii** (but you can call me **Dima** for short), and I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for **NLP** and **bioinformatics**.

With an extensive background in **analytics** and **data science**, I have worked on a variety of projects ‚Äì from **RAG & Agents** in the finance and **EdTech** sectors to **NLP pipelines** for **HR** and **investor relations**. My experience ranges from **analytics** to deploying **ML models** into production. üöÄ

Outside of my professional life, I'm a huge fan of **hackathons** and contributing to **open-source projects**. üíª

In my free time, I enjoy **learning new languages** and **ultra-distance cycling** üö¥.
